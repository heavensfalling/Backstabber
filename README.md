# Backstabber 


Backstabber is a specialized positioning assistant for World of Warcraft (1.12.1). It provides a clear, real-time visual indicator to determine if you are perfectly positioned behind your target to use abilities like Backstab, Ambush, or Garrote.

⚠️ Requirements

SuperWoW / UnitXP: This addon requires the custom API functions provided by SuperWoW (or a compatible UnitXP module) to accurately detect player positioning relative to the target's hitbox. Without this, the addon cannot determine if you are truly "behind" the target.
