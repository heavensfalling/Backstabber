# Backstabber 


Specialized positioning assistant for World of Warcraft (1.12.1). It provides a clear, real-time visual indicator to determine if you are perfectly positioned behind your target to use abilities like Backstab, Ambush, or Garrote.


⚠️  Requirements 

SuperWoW & UnitXP (Required for Accuracy)
This addon relies on SuperWoW and the UnitXP module to function correctly. The standard 1.12.1 API cannot accurately detect if you are behind a mob; UnitXP unlocks the custom API functions needed for precise, real-time positioning.




⚙️  You can access the settings menu via the Minimap Button or by using slash commands:

/bs - Toggles the options menu.

/backstabber - Toggles the options menu.



Developed by Wristcry. Free to use, provided you know the magic word :)
